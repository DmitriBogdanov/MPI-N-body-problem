# MPI N-body problem

Contains serial and parallel (MPI) implementations of standard N-body problem:

Let $m_i$ --- bodies' masses, that we will consider as material points,
&&r_i(0) = r_{i0} = (x_{i0}, y_{i0}, z_{i0})^{T} \text{--- initial bodies' positions,}&&
&&v_i(0) = v_{i0} = (v_{x,i0}, v{y,i0}, v_{z,i0})^{T} \text{--- initial bodies' velocities.}&&
